I noticed a of small problems at the company, and close accidents.
Here are a couple of problems that occur on a weekly to daily basis.

# scenario 1: long waiting time
I had the pleasure of experiencing that in a narrow street in hilly Ellzelles, we could not pass. However, there were two other garbage trucks coming behind us, as we where all on our way to a certain area.
This created a small traffic jam as it was really hard to manoeuvre all three truck safely backwards on a small road (not ven in-calculating the other civilian cars).


## Possible solutions:
The congestion could have gone smoother if the first driver had communicated this to his colleagues. 
This could be done via current methods using texts or calling, but a simple notification on a certain app that would alert other drivers, would simplify the process. A map to Pin obstacles, similar to Waze.


# scenario 2: poor communication
The rules at Renewi Ronse are simple: all streets for today must be done, who or how does not matter. They think as a team and always help each other where necessary as they all have bad days. It’s an unwritten rule, but very respected.

It happens quit often that a street or part of a street is done by two teams, as it makes life more easy for everyone. But not everyone thinks on the same wavelength, and communication can be a catalyst to a good day.

We where just finished with our route and another driver contacted us to ask if we could help him finishing his route. 
The drivers got in an argument as the couldn't communicate the correct street names over the phone, as they both argued against each other logic to which exact streets.
Our driver patiently tried to write down all the communicated streets with a pen on his own map. But he couldn’t understand the logic of why he had to do it and why the other guy couldn’t do it himself.

Int he end our drive just drove back to the depot. On arrival we heard that the other guy didn’t finish his route, as he thought we where going to finish it.
So we had to return and finish his job on a blisteringly hot summer day, because there was no one else, as the other driver was already home.


## Possible solutions:
A system that would allow a driver to send a college a request to do an extra street(s), which the college can accept or send an alternative, instead of communicating this over the phone is sometimes multiple languages.


# Scenario 3: Packages
It often happens that at the end of the day, team A their truck is fully loaded at, and team B still has a lot of space.
Out of solidarity and to make the best use of their time, team B makes big piles of all the PDM bags from “street X” and place this pile at certain point, like on the side of a field. 
They call this pile a “package”.
This is done more than once a day and it not communicated directly, as you assumed that everyone always takes the same route.
But if team B sees that everything has already been removed from “street X” they might take a different route, depending on how much the drivers in that area now each other and the route.
It happens that the team A has to drive back. Or worse: the package is forgotten and is spreading is perfuming smell for another 24hours and on a hot summer day, which is a booming business for maggots and wasps. 

## Possible solutions:
Again, a simple pin on a map. In an advanced scenario, this pin is only visible for team A, or is only going to disappear if team A in on location (in case multiple other trucks driving the same road).


Summary
A medium that has a Map with Pins (like Waze) which can be placed by rivers to communicate obstakels and Packages. This medium should include a notification system to alert drivers of pins.
There should be the possibility for drivers to share or interchange parts of their route.

This would not only reduce cost, carbon output and efficiency, but also improve the quality of life for the drivers, garbage man and the people putting out the trash.

The environmental importance and efficiency will be disused in more detail later.
