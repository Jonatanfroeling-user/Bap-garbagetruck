Research on navigation systems
One of the major technical challenges is to design an efficient navigation system for garbage truck drivers.
I am an advocate of open source and centralization of software, with the end result being as independent of third parties as possible.

Selected terms:

Turn-by-turn navigation: gives you spoken directions in your car through your speakers and uses Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to get you to your destination.

Geofences: virtual fence or perimeter around a physical location (Wikipedia contributors, 2023)

Existing solutions
There are a large number of navigation systems available that are good solutions for their specific purposes. But few systems offer an efficient solution for garbage truck drivers. 

I discuss here only companies -and or software that offer the ability to serve as a navigation system for a garbage truck. These companies often have multiple products that are not always relevant to this research.
Only relevant products are discussed and their main specifications or features that can serve as possible inspiration.

Target market: garbage truck companies


Two of their products:

Map-pak
Route management and optimization software for refuse haulers.

Specifications:
	- Uses Google Maps
	- Visual representation of routes in different colors
	- Updates new streets automatically (no software to load)
	- Uses device location service directly
	- Visually optimize, move and resume stops on routes
	- Create geofences and receive email alerts when drivers enter and exit the vehicle


Mobile-pack
Software and app for drivers.

Specifications:
	- Real-time GPS tracking using Google Maps
	- Scheduled and on-call work is immediately sent to drivers
	- Mapping of local streets and highways
	- Photo capabilities for overloaded/blocked containers
	- All driver activity is recorded
	- Recorded service time for each stop
	- Display of list of possible routes
	- Option to stop routes

Summary:
Provides capability as a working route planner for a garbage truck. It works by loading multiple routes into Google maps. But this results in a cluttered and unkempt UI and UX and less control as a developer.

Inspiration:
	- Notification to admin when vehicle leaves area of route (geofencing).
	- A list of all possible routes
